# dad-jokes-react
This application was created using create-react-app. The application uses the [ICanHazDadJoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to generate dad jokes. The application allows the user to upvote and downvote dad jokes. After each upvote/downvote the jokes are then sorted by most upvotes to least. This application uses window.localStorage to store jokes and votes so that after a refresh the jokes are still rendered.
